    "<span style=\"color:rgb(255,128,128)\"> **Is it OK that δ2 of the FIDES πProcess is fixed of 2.079 on all parts? (ΠProcess: 2.079 if 1 to 8)**</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the πProcess is a value that represent the impact of all the processes used by the companies which are part of the same project. It evaluates them from the specification up to the maintenance phase.\n",
    "This was introduced in the FIDES methodology, because in the late 90s, it appeared clearly that most of the failures derivate from process failures and not from intrinsic failures of electronic components (bad specification, wrong parameter on a production tool, and so on). For example, in the early 2000s, many of the French major companies identified that 70% of the electronic failures were due to process failures. Then it was necessary to take it into consideration into a reliability methodology, and that was one of the strongest recommendations for FIDES.\n",
    "The first FIDES team, which founded the methodology, evaluated that the process part could have an influence by decreasing the reliability by a factor between 1 to 8. So, this is the reason why δ2 is set to 2.079 in order to force the πProcess in an interval between 1 and 8. To have a better understanding of the πProcess and what it stands for, we will illustrate it on an example. \n",
    "If the JAXA, the ESA and the ISRO decided to perform exactly the same satellite, with the same components, the same electronic schemes and you put the 3 satellites on the same mission, you will see that the 3 satellites will have different reliability (with 217F you will have exactly the same). These differences will be linked with the know-how of the 3 companies. This experience and know-how are materialized through the process used by each of the 3 companies, those process will lead to \"\"a level of rigor\"\" toward different aspect including electronic reliability. Then the πProcess factor is there to evaluate the strength of your process toward electronic reliability.\n",
    "Of course, you can also use this πProcess evaluation to find some improvement process aspect. And we are aware that we cannot be sure that the πProcess evaluation is exhaustive and perfectly design but it gives some convincing results to the companies which using it.\n"

    "The default πProcess value is 4. The FIDES community feedback is that most of French major companies have a much better value of πProcess (which includes the space prime companies).It means that a value of 4 should be very conservative for the JAMSS and it will be not very relevant to apply the default value.\n",

In general, Airbus Defence & Space and Thales Alenia Space designs, for standard space applications, are evaluated below 1.3. For New Space, it is a little higher (between 1.3 and 2)."

Then on the audit days (typically we need 2 or 3 days of audit to fully perform it) you should check all the proof provided and inquire about the question without proof in order to check if you can find one directly with the interlocutors.\n",
    "Of course, there is the restitution time in order to share the results and particularly the very good points and the aspects which could be improved in order to increase electronic reliability. This work must be done at the prime company and all its subcontractors in order to determine the project's actual πProcess. \n",
