    "FIDES is not based on some database like 217F. It was made from failure analyses performed by different companies. As no company from the Space industry was involved when FIDES was first developed, no such data from Space was used to build the models.\n",
    "Despite all of it, the FIDES models are based on physic of faillure principles and can be applied in every industry field. Nevertheless, they will not consider failures induced by the Space environment,  which are generally evaluated through specific studies (radiations, impact of the vacuum, debris mitigation...).\n",
    "The NRPM study, founded by ESA since 2017 and allowing releasing a new handbook called Reliability.Space by end 2020, that you can find at www.reliability.space, demonstrated that FIDES could be applied, with some adaptations, to the Space environment."

    "For Space applications, we do not model all of the phases, just the most important ones (for ex: Storage not to be considered if it is only 2 months vs a 10-year mission in orbit). \n",

    "For launch: it has been analysed that the relative impact is too little to be considered (even with the huge mechanical stress).\n",
    "Also, we do not convert the mission time to the equivalent of a year duration (8760h), but we model it over the whole mission time (ex: 87600 h for a ten year mission) - it makes no difference in the end, and makes it easier to understand and to apply for space missions.\n",

    "The reason is probably because the first types of mission profiles that came to mind when it was built were plane profiles. But for elements such as satellites, it is not possible, or at least does make little sense, to speak in \"\"mean year\"\". Though, in the FIDES guide, in the mission profile section, it is indicated that you can model the whole mission with its actual duration."
