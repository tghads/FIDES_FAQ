    "217F and FIDES are not made with the same kind of value. Then you cannot compare the two, they do not evaluate the failure rate the same way with the same complexity or failure mechanism. Thus, this not recommend to mix the two methodologies in a same system evaluation. We are aware that it is complicated to avoid using data from 217F at the time, particularly in case of reuse. So, if it is impossible to avoid it, you should be aware of the following issue:\n",
    "The 217F and FIDES are not consistent, 217F rely on a predefined environment (operational hour) and FIDES rely on mission profile (calendar hour), so the results cannot be directly compared or even mixed. At least it is necessary to adapt the 217F results to the same mission profile (it could be achieved by creating a mission profile equivalent by using environment and thermal data in order to fit with the FIDES mission profile. Then you will use weighted arithmetic mean of failure rates, weighted by the time of each phase of the mission profile, in the aim to make your results consistent with a calendar time). A guidebook is available on FIDES website on this topic."
